# Python-Projects
This repository contains my Python projects, experiments, and learning journey. From basic scripts to more advanced projects, I'll be exploring different concepts and improving my coding skills along the way.

Project 1:
"Text-to-Speech Python Script"
A python program that converts text into speech using a TTS library.

Project 2:
"Snake Water Gun Game in Python"
A simple Python game where the user competes against the computer in a classic Snake-Water-Gun challenge. The computer randomly selects its choice, and the winner is decided based on game rules mentioned below:
